# Hello, World!

## What is "Hello, world!"?

A "Hello, world!" program is generally a basic program that outputs "Hello, world!". In our case, it would be something different because HTML has way more than just that!

For this project, I will show you the basic syntax of HTML. The text isn't the familiar "Hello, world!", but the basic concept remains.
